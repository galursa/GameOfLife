## Conway's cellular automata

It is a simple program for exploring aforementioned cellular automata. 
In classic Conway's version we chose specified cells for make new cells live or dead. 
In this version we can change the rules by giving numbers of adjecent cells for making live present cells or for making dead present cells.
First we must make initial file with starting state of cellular automata. In this file 0 stands for dead cell and 1 stand for live cell.
